# Suppress false positives from Arc.
# This is supposed to be fixed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65097,
# but tsan still reports races in Arc::drop. Why??
# The grading script doesn't test Arc, but we still have it listed here anyway so that
# `cargo_tsan test` does not give out false positives.
race:Arc

# boc tests
race:crossbeam_deque

# uses fences
race:crossbeam_epoch
